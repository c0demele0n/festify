These are Cordova resources. You can replace icon.png and splash.png in each
platform and run `ionic cordova resources` to generate custom icons and splash
screens for your app. See `ionic cordova resources --help` for details.

Cordova reference documentation:

* Icons: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/images.html
* Splash Screens:
  https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/

Notes: iOS does not support transparent background in icon so it replaces
transparency by black. Keep this in mind. For fest-ion added borders to make it
look better.
